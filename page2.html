<h4 style="color:blue;">my very first video game</h4>

<p>
  my first game I played was halo combat evolved, it was one of my favorites video games when I was 5 years old. I had no idea on what I was doing in the game, 
  because I was so little, but through my gaming life I managed to get the hang of it, I also was like this with other games when i was little.
